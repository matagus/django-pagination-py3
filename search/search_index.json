Your settings file might look something like::</li> </ol> <pre><code>       INSTALLED_APPS = (\n           # ...\n           'pagination',\n       )\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>Install the pagination middleware.

This could take one of two forms (using the canonical <code>object_list</code> as an example variable):</li> </ol> <pre><code>       {% autopaginate object_list %}\n</code></pre> <p>This assumes that you would like to have the default 20 results per page. If you would like to specify your own amount of results per page, you can specify that like so:</p> <pre><code>       {% autopaginate object_list 10 %}\n</code></pre> <p>Note that this replaces <code>object_list</code> with the list for the current page, so you can iterate over the <code>object_list</code> like you normally would.</p> <ol> <li>Now you want to display the current page and the available pages, so somewhere after having used autopaginate, use the paginate inclusion tag:</li> </ol> <pre><code>       {% paginate %}\n</code></pre> <p>This does not take any arguments, but does assume that you have already called autopaginate, so make sure to do so first.</p> <p>That's it!  You have now paginated <code>object_list</code> and given users of the sitea a way to navigate between the different pages--all without touching your views.</p>"},{"location":"#a-note-about-uploads","title":"A Note About Uploads","text":"<p>It is important, when using django-pagination-py3 in conjunction with file uploads, to be aware of when <code>request.page</code> is accessed.
